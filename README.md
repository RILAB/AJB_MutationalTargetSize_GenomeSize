### AJB_review: this is the repo for perspective "Adaptation in plant genomes: bigger isnâ€™t better, but it's probably different" for American Journal of Botany "On the Nature of Things" serial

## **Where are functional mutations in maize**
* Lots of functional mutations are outside of coding sequence
* Lots of stuff showing selection includes regulatory sequence, and some regions showing selection have no genes in them

## **What selection looks like in other organisms**
* Enrichment of selection on nonsynonymous sites
* No enrichment for nonsyn in humans (large genome) or most plants
* Selection on noncoding sites
* Thoughts on soft sweeps
